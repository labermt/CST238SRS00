My First App

Name: Daniel Lee (Junhyeong)

Notes: I didn't realize until Monday July 2nd, that there was more to be done for this program then
running the Hello World program. And once I attempted to continue, I had a visual bug that prevented
me from continuing any further. May have fixed it right before class.

Issues: There was a visual error with the program that did not allow me to continue with building
a simple user interface or starting another activity. Without being able to adjust the textbox or
buttons, I could not finish even with Mitch's help. Will hopefully finish by Saturday.
