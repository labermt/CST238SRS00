My First App

Name: Cobe Greene

Notes: In the tutorial, it ask us to adjust the font and color of the message after the user press send. I decide to increase the font size, but also change the color to the project primary dark color which is a dark blue. This was a design choice, the other options were the project's accent color, project's primary color, or a custom color. My understanding is that the accent color is suppose to stand out, and if the user enter a blob of text then I felt that the color would overwhelm the user. I like the primary dark color over just the primary because it is closer to a grey or black color which is what user expects from text. I've could of choose a dark grey or a custom color, but I felt it look more unified if it was one of the project's theme color. 

Issues: I was able to get it to run on the emulator, but it was slow and I had to increase the given amount of ram to 4gb.
