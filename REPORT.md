My First App

Name: Silverio Reyes

Notes: In developing the application to display a message entered by a user to a seperate screen (activity), I passed an intent which is an object that proivdes runtime binding between seperate components. Also in designing the layout for the main activity, I learned about "chain" in which I was tasked to create a horizontal chain. Basically, what this does it creates the layout to be responsive based on any screen size. For example, if you were to view the layout horizontally instead of vertically, the layout design would take up the horizontal space based on the screen size so that its porpotional to the user's viewing margins. 

Issues: When debugging the application, there were two options that could be used such as the emulator(virtual device) or a connected device. I installed the lastest API to run the virtual device however, it was unable to capture the application during run time. I investigated this and also edited the emulated performace graphics by changing from the automatic selection to hardware and then trying the software option. The issue is still being investigated but for now I was able to run and debug the application using a connected mobile device.
